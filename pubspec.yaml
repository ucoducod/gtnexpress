## The following defines the version and build number for your application.
## A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
## followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
## Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
## build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
## In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
## Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
## In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
